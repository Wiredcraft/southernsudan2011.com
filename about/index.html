      <p>The <a href="http://ssrc.sd/SSRC/index.php">Southern Sudan Referendum Commission (SSRC)</a> in Khartoum is responsible for conducting the 2011 Southern Sudan Referendum in conjunction with its subsidiary in Juba, the <a href="http://www.ssrbureau.org">Southern Sudan Referendum Bureau (SSRB)</a>. The referendum is mandated within the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement and will decide whether the ten states of Southern Sudan will remain in a unified Sudan or vote for independence.</p>
<p>The referendum was conducted from the 9th until the 15th of January 2011. The results of the referendum have been counted and are now undergoing tabulation and verification at the SSRC/SSRB Data Centers in Khartoum and Juba.</p>
<h2>Content of the Website</h2>
<p>The Southern Sudan Referendum results website will display the amount of votes for the two polling options: Unity or Secession. Additional data displayed includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The total votes cast and percentage results by state, county, and referendum center.</li>
<li>The percentage of valid votes cast for the two polling options with 50% + 1 of the votes.</li>
<li>The percentage of votes cast in relation to the legal threshold of 60% of registered voters.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Results Process Overview</h2>
<p>Referendum results will be counted at every Referendum Center immediately following the close of polls on the final day of polling. The results will be displayed for public viewing at each Referendum Center.</p>
<p>In Southern Sudan, copies of the results forms from the respective Referendum Centers will be forwarded to each of the County Sub-Committees, State High Committees, and Data Center in Juba for tabulation and aggregation. Only the Data Center in Juba has the authority to verify and announce the preliminary results for the ten states of Southern Sudan.</p>
<p>In Northern Sudan, no aggregation will occur at the state-level. All results forms will be sent directly to the Data Center in Khartoum for tabulation and aggregation.</p>
<p>For Out of Country Voting (OCV), the results forms from each Referendum Center will be forwarded to the Country Offices for aggregation and public displaying. The results will be declared as “Results for the Country” and forwarded to the Data Centre in Khartoum for aggregation and verification.</p>
<p>Once results are received from all State Referendum Committees in Northern Sudan and the eight OCV Country Offices, verified by the Data Center in Khartoum, and approved by the SSRC, they will be declared as “Results for Other Locations” and displayed for public viewing.</p>
<p>After declaring results for other locations and receiving the results for Southern Sudan, the SSRC will aggregate both sets of results and declare them as the “Preliminary Results for the Referendum”. The final certified results will be announced after the conclusion of any appeals received to the competent courts in Northern and Southern Sudan.</p>
